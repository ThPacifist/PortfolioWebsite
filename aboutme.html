                Hello, My name is Benjamin and I am a programmer based in the United States. I love video games and I also love making them. I specifically love the programming
                part of the video games. I consider myself a gameplay programmer, but I want to try all the different kinds of programming that go into a video game, such as 
                engine, graphic, animation, and more. 

                <br><br>

                During my free-time, I like to work on personal projects that allow me to learn other techniques and hone my skills. Also, whenever I start new project I always have goal
                in mind, where I try something new. Such as, dynamic animation, Artifical intelligence, random terrain generation and more. Currently I don't have much 
                professional experience, but I try to make up for that with motivaiton and passion towards my projects.

                <br><br>
