                <h5>The Lighting System</h5>
                <p>
                    When I was making the lighting system for this game, I was trying figure out how to reveal objects with a light. So, I started messing with Unity's light component to try to get what I wanted. I got it to change the color of any sprites in range, but I wasn't making head way. So, I instead made a script where any objects that were within range of the light would turn on they visuals and whenever the player moved away they would turn off. Sadly, this version wasn't what I was picturing. It was like if you were standing in a room where you could only see the walls, and objects would "pop in" unless you got close enough to the them.
                    <br>
                    So, I tried looking for another method. It wasn't untill one of my team members told me about sprite masks and how they worked. I set to work trying to implement it and it worked. It was exactly how I pictured this mechanic working. Where it was like a light in a dark room, where you can only see what is within range of the light.

                <h5>The Watcher</h5>
                <p>
                    The Watcher is an AI I built for one of the two enemies within our game. It's supposed to sit in the dark, while following you around the manor. If you get too close to him, it will attack you while jumpscaring you.
                    <br>
                    It follows you by keeping track of what floor you are on and than attempts to find you by trying to teleporting to your room, though it selects a random room from the ones surrounding the player and the one it's located in. That way it can give you some time alone away from him. That way you can take of the puzzles without much hindering you.
                    <br>
                    When making this AI, I tried breaking down what I wanted it to do into questions, like how does it know where players, how does it know what room is, etc. For the rooms, I stored each of the rooms as number in an array. This gives it a database to keep track of where the players and where it is in the manor. Then using this database it would check to see if it was in the same room as the player. If it wasn't it would attempt to teleport to the player. After that, it would move to a designated spot and wait for the player.

                <h5>The Picture Puzzle</h5>
                <p>
                    For this puzzle, you had to locate pictures in the manor that you must use in order to solve the puzzle. The pictures had various dates that would give you a clue on how to solve it. Said dates are randomly assigned by another script at runtime.
                    <br>
                    For this puzzle I implemented the dragging and dropping of the pictures. Unity has built-in interfaces which you can use to help speed along process. I choose to use these as I didn't really know how to implement a lot of the other parts to selecting UI elements and didn't have the time. I also implemented slots for the pictures as a way to store them and so that they would snap into the correct spaces and be easier to read. The pictures would have dates on them, which would be assigned to them at random. That way there were no two journeys were alike.
