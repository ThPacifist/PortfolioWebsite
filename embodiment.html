            <h2>What I Learned</h2>
            <h3>Programming</h3>
            <p>
                For the programming side of the project, I worked on some of the small mechanics used throughout the puzzles, such as buttons, lever switches, a treadmill, etc.
                <br>
                I also had a role in the refactoring of our player scripts. This was a huge project. We had to split up one of our biggest scripts into 5-6 other scripts, that way the code would be more organized and simpler. We made use of c# inheritance and encapsulation functionality as much as we could to help simplfy the process. The end goal was to have all the similar behaviors in one place and the behaviors distinct to each form in separate scripts. In the end it helped, we were able to make the code more organized and made other future additions easier to add.
                <br>
                Besides the major script rework, I also worked on the specific abilities of each of the forms, like:
                <ul id="blobForms">

            <h3>Dynamic Animation</h3>
            <p>
                A year after the project was finished, I returned to this project to work on something I always wanted to do during the development of this project, but never
                had the time nor reason to do it. <strong> Dynamic Animation. </strong> Animation that is defined from math and drawn using Unity's built-in drawing tools. It would look more fluid, fit with the artstyle, and be a nice detail. I decided to take up this challenge cause I always wanted to see how dynamic animation was done. As if this writing this is the current version:
                <img src="pictures\Embodiment\DynamicAnimation.gif" style="margin: auto; display: block;">

            <h3>Leadership</h3>
            <p>
                As the team lead, I had a lot more responsiblities than other projects I have worked on. In the beginning of the project, I realized my original plan to have the game in 2.5D was not going to work, because it would've taken way too long for us to get the 3D models working. So, I decided to scrap that idea and switched to more detail 2D artstyle.
                <br>
                After a while though, we realized the current artstyle wasn't working, but thanks to an idea from one of my teammates. We switched to a more simplistic artstyle. It would allow our game to have more distinct artstyle and stand out.
                <br>
                Another issue we ran into was with the scripts related to the player. Specifically, the scripts related too the emboding of skeletons and the skeletons themselves. The scripts were becoming too large and cumbersome. So, I decided that me and other programmer would work to refactor the code so that it was more organized and worked better for what we needed. It took some time, but I was able to come with plan, and implment it, and I believe it worked out for the better.
