                Take control of the blob, a living pile of ooze that has the ability to take control of skeletons. You must then use these skeletons and there powers to solve puzzles and traverse the lab. Hopefully, being able to find a way out.

            <h2>What I Learned</h2>
            <p>
                This was my senior year project at college. I was both the team anc creative lead of the project. So, not only was I tasked with programming funcationality of the game, but I also had to be the one to divvy up tasks and plan out the roadmap of the game.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Leadrship</h3>
            <p>
                As the team lead, I had a lot more responsiblities than other projects I have worked on. In the beginning of the project, I realized my original plan to have the game in 2.5D was not going to work, because it would've taken way too long for us to get the models working. So, I decided to scrap that idea and switched to more detail 2D artstyle.
                <br>
                After a while though, we realized the current artstyle wasn't working, but thanks to an idea from one of my teammates. We switched to a more simplistic artstyle. It would allow our game to have more distinct artstyle and stand out.
                <br>
                Another issue we ran into was with the scripts related to the player. Specifically, the scripts related too the emboding of skeletons and the skeletons themselves. The scripts were becoming too large and cumbersome. So, I decided that me and otehr program would work to refactor the code so that it was more organized and worked better for what we needed. It took some time, but I was able to come with plan and I believe it worked out for the better.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Programming</h3>
            <p>
                For the programming side of the project, I worked on some of the small mechanics used throughout for the puzzles, such as buttons, lever switches, a treadmill, etc.
                <br>
                I also had a role in the refactoring of our player scripts. This was a huge project. We had split up one of massive scripts into 5-6 other scripts, that way things would be more organized and simpler. We made use c# inheritance and encapsulation funcationality as much as we could to help simplfy the process. This would allow us to have all the funcationality that each of the forms share in one place and separate there distinct funcitons into there respective scripts.
                <br>
                Speaking of these scripts, I also programming the distinct abilities of the different forms, such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>The Blob can swing from points using its tentacles and pick up skeleton piles</li>
                    <li>The Human can pick up and throw boxes</li>
                    <li>The Bat can fly and also pick up boxes</li>
                    <li>The Fish can swimg and do a tail spin</li>
                    <li>The Cat can climb walls and is the fastest on land</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
            <h2>Extracurricular Work</h2>
            <p>
                A year after the project was finished, I returned to this project to work on something I always wanted to do during the development of this project, but never
                had the time or reason to do it. Dynamic Animation. Animation that is defined from math and drawn using Unity's built-in drawing tools. It would look more
                fluid, fit with the artstyle, and be a nice detail.
                <br>
                I decided to take up this challenge cause I always wanted to see how dynamic animation was done.
